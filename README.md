# HomeSchoolingVsTraditionalSchooling
A prediction model which recommends which schooling system is better for your kid based on your kid's traits.
Regression models such as Logistic and SVM are used where they trained on a dataset containing details such as age,performace oustide home, performance at home, social activity and target.Since models understand bits like 1 or 0, I have trained the model to send the output as 1 if the kid would do better in a home schooling environment, and 0 if traditional schooling is a better option. As we are all living in a fast paced world, most of us are unaware of the fact that we might be dealing with anxiety/panic attacks too, and especially it's hard on kids, especially with factors like peer pressure etc.
This model helps to make the decision easy for parents to make sure they can give a better future for their kids by knowing and understanding their kids better as well.
